# Drum-kit

I have developed a web application inspired by a drum kit. This application allows users to play the drum kit using both keyboard keys and mouse interactions.

## Features

- Realistic Drum Sounds: The application provides a realistic drumming experience with high-quality drum sounds.

- Keyboard Interaction: Users can play the drum kit by pressing the corresponding keys on their keyboard. Each key is associated with a specific drum sound, allowing for easy and intuitive drumming.

- Mouse Interaction: In addition to keyboard input, users can also click on the drum kit's graphical representation with their mouse. Clicking on a drum element triggers the associated drum sound, providing an alternative way to play.

- Responsive Design: The web application is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable user experience.

- Intuitive User Interface: The user interface is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for both beginners and experienced drummers to enjoy playing the virtual drum kit.

## How to Play

1. Launch the "index.html" in your web browser.

2. Choose your preferred method of interaction - either keyboard or mouse.

3. For keyboard interaction, press the corresponding keys displayed on the virtual drum kit to play the desired drum sound.

4. For mouse interaction, simply click on the drum elements to trigger the associated drum sound.

5. Get creative and experiment with different rhythms and beats!
